What's NPOI
This repository is fork of [NPOI](https://github.com/nissl-lab/npoi). Syncing with upstream repository will be implemented like in the following [article](https://medium.com/sweetmeat/how-to-keep-a-downstream-git-repository-current-with-upstream-repository-changes-10b76fad6d97).

To work with the repository on local machine:

Run Git bash or Command Line. In it run commands:

`cd c:/your_folder_with/repos`

`git clone git@github.com:jake-codes-at-5-am/npoi.git # clones this fork to the location c:/your_folder_with/repos/npoi`

`cd npoi # to get into the folder with the repo`

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:nissl-lab/npoi.git # this will add an upstream remote to our repo`

`git pull upstream master # to pull all the changes from an upstream remote, branch master`
